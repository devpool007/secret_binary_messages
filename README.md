# secret_binary_messages
Simple binary secret message decoder
Just run the c file 
and enter temp.txt file or make your own, this one prints my name as it is the decode message here made as a fun challenge :)

To run it just do the following in terminal or cmd
1. gcc -o code hack.c
2. ./code
Enter file name:
temp.txt

Put any binary text you want to decode in temp.txt manually before doing so also once Step 1 has been done you only need to run Step 2 in terminal next time.
